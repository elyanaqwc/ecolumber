        <h4>Our Sister Company</h4>
        <h2>Established in 1962</h2>
        <h3>SENG PENG SAWMILLS SDN BHD </h3>
        <p>is based in Kuantan, Pahang, and operates from a 50-acre industrial site in Gambang, Pahang.

            According to company founder and Managing Director Dato’ Loo Swee Thing, “Our company engages in four primary operations: sawmilling, kiln-drying, moulding, and logging.”
            
            The sawmilling division features a breakdown bandsaw, an auto pony saw, and 13 band saws, with a monthly production capacity of approximately 3,000 tons. The kiln-drying facilities include six chambers for 70 tons and five chambers for 50 tons, enabling the drying of up to 600 tons of timber per shift.
            
            In the moulding sector, the company utilizes three finger-jointing machines, four spindle moulders, two jump saws, three rip/multiple/circular/arm saws, and an opticut software system. Seng Peng Sawmills produces timber flooring and door and window frames, primarily for the Japanese and European markets.<br><br>
            
            Dato’ Loo notes, “In addition to Japan and Europe, our other significant export markets include Thailand and the Middle East, which together account for 80% of our total production. The remaining 20% is distributed locally.”
            
            The company sources its raw materials from 5,000 hectares of forest concessions, ensuring adherence to sustainable forest management practices. This commitment guarantees that the timber is from sustainable sources. Major timber species include Kempas, Keruing, Meranti, and Ramin, with additional sources from plantations such as Durian and Rubberwood.
            
            To add value to by-products like sawdust and wood chips, Seng Peng Sawmills is establishing a pellet-manufacturing line. These pellets will be exported to markets including South Korea, Japan, and Singapore, as well as supplied locally.
            
            By December 2022, Seng Peng Sawmills Sdn Bhd will celebrate its 60th anniversary in the timber industry. In addition to marking this milestone, the company aims to become a fully integrated timber organization, expanding into the production of fully finished products such as furniture for its established Japanese and European markets, as stated by Dato’ Loo.<br><br>
            Eco Lumber collaborates closely with Seng Peng Sawmills, leveraging their expertise and sustainable practices to enhance our timber products and services.</p></div>
